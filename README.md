# DogYears
A script to calculate a dog's age in dog years using information from the American Kennel Club (AKC) website.

This started out me teaching myself some Python.  It seemed like a simple project, just
do some math and get a dog's age. The math uses the AKCs research in how a dog ages 
throughout it's life compared to humans.

I wondered about putting it in a GUI and discovered PySimpmleGui. So simple to use, but
some advanced features also.
