# Dog Years
Script to calculate a dog's age in dog years using information from the American Kennel Club (AKC) website.
GUI makes it easy to get a date and then see the result.

First Python project, just learning how to code.

It seemed like a simple project, just do some math and get a dog's age. 

The script started out of curiosity as a way to learn something new.
Messing with the code and PySimpleGUI, trying different things.
It's a mishmash, learning how to do things with Python and then
presenting that in the GUI.

Dogs don't age at the same rate as humans. Historically the ratio has
been 7:1 - 7 dog years to 1 human year. The American Kennel Club(AKC)
has studied dog aging and come up with new information. They found that
dogs age much more rapidly in the first two years and then slow down
some.  They also discovered that the general size and weight of the dog
has a factor in aging. When a puppy is 8 human months old, it is 10 years 
in dog age.

The script takes a dog's birth date, gets the number of human years and
months the dog has been alive today and converts that to dog years.
